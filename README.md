shelter is a new generation client mod built to be essentially bulletproof.

It is developed by ex-members of the old Cumcord Team, under [uwu.network](https://uwu.network/).

See the website at https://shelter.uwu.network for further information.

We are constantly working to improve shelter and its ecosystem.
Keep an eye on the uwu gh org or [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/FhHQQrVs7U)
to see what we are working on, inside and outside of the client modding space. :)
