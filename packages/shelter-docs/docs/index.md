#features:
#  - title: Robustness
#    details: |
#        shelter is built to rely as little as possible on volatile components of Discord's internals.
#        It has already survived a major Discord tooling change essentially unscathed.
#  - title: No node requirement
#    details: |
#        shelter works entirely within the web, even on electron Discord. This means you do not have fragments of
#        shelter-related things all over your computer, and making it work in browsers is relatively easy.
#  - title: Developer Friendly
#    details: |
#        shelter has developer tooling included out of the box, including a hot-reload devmode using our own build tool,
#        useful (though unconventional) APIs, and above-average documentation for a client mod.

shelter is a new generation client mod built to be essentially bulletproof.

It began development as a response to the death of many client mods in late September 2022, better explained in
[*An Exercise in Futility*](https://web.archive.org/web/20230726025103/https://cumcord.com/an-exercise-in-futility).

shelter is developed by uwu.network, which formed of the remains of the Cumcord Team.

shelter has been lightly maintained continuously since its release in late 2022, and has not broken due to a Discord
update once since (over two years!). This is in stark contrast to most other client mods.
