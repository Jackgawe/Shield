# shelter UI

A set of UI components designed to look identical to Discord's, built entirely in solid.

Please look at the shelter documentation page (//TODO: hyperlink) for shelter UI.

Inside Discord, these are exported to you on `shelter.ui`.
Outside of Discord, use `@uwu/shelter-ui`, and import `@uwu/shelter-ui/compat.css` somewhere in your project to fix
missing styles.
